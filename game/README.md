There are two versions of the "guess the number" game in these two folders. Clients can connect in unlimited quantities. In the first version, one of the clients guesses a number, in the second version it is done by the server. I am very sorry, but there is not enough time to implement something less narrow-minded than this. To quickly check the functionality of programs, you can run clients with IP 127.0.0.1 in command line arguments.
